# Yamina – Auto RTL for Hebrew & Arabic

A Chrome extension. Click its toolbar button on a site to switch it on there:
every text block — `<div>`, `<p>`, `<li>`, heading, `<blockquote>` — whose
text is mostly (over 50%) Hebrew or Arabic letters is set right-to-left and
right-aligned. Click again to switch it off.

- **Per site** = per hostname (`mail.google.com` and `gmail.com` are separate).
  A site stays on across visits and browser restarts until you switch it off.
- **Each block is judged by its own text** — text inside nested blocks is left
  out. So a message whose text all sits in paragraphs is left alone and each
  paragraph gets its own direction (a Hebrew paragraph and an English one in
  the same message both come out right), and a page-wide wrapper never flips
  just because the page is mostly Hebrew. Blocks with no text of their own are
  never touched.
- **Letters only** — spaces, digits, punctuation and emoji don't count either way.
- An English block inside a flipped Hebrew one is set back to left-to-right.
- Keeps working as the page changes (chat messages arriving, infinite scroll,
  typing into an editable box). One observer for the whole page queues only
  the blocks that changed; they're checked in the browser's idle time, a few
  milliseconds at a time, so scrolling and typing never wait on it (within a
  second at most, even on a page that's never idle).
- A flipped list item keeps its bullet inside it, on the right.
- The button shows **ON** where it's active, and **!** on pages it can't run on
  (browser pages like `chrome://`, the Web Store, local files).

## Permissions

None at install. The first click on a site asks Chrome for access to **that
site only**; switching the site off gives the access back. Being on for a site
*is* holding its permission: Chrome keeps granted sites until they're removed,
and the extension registers its script for exactly those sites, so nothing runs
anywhere else. Sites can also be removed from the extension's page in Chrome
(`chrome://extensions` → Details → Site access).

- `activeTab` — lets the button read the current tab's address when clicked.
- `scripting` — runs the script on the sites that are on.
- `optional_host_permissions: *://*/*` — the upper bound of what may be
  requested, one site at a time; nothing is granted until you click.

## Install (unpacked)

1. Chrome → `chrome://extensions` → turn on **Developer mode** (top right).
2. **Load unpacked** → pick this folder.

After changing the code: the circular arrow on the extension's card, then
reload the tab.

## Files

- `manifest.json` — Manifest V3.
- `background.js` — the toolbar button: asks for / gives back the site, keeps
  the script registered for exactly the granted sites, shows the badge.
- `content.js` — the behavior on the page: checking the blocks, watching the
  page for changes.
- `icons/` — drawn by `tools/make-icons.py` (Python standard library only).
- `test/demo.html` — one example per rule, plus a button that adds 500
  messages at once. Serve it over HTTP to try it (the
  extension doesn't run on local files), e.g. `python3 -m http.server` in this
  folder, then open `http://localhost:8000/test/demo.html`.
